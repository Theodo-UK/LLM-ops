# OmniLog testing

## Dev
To use the OmniLog package, you only need to duplicate the `omnilog` folder of `sdk-python/src` to the `example` folder.

## Prod
For the time being, using the OmniLog package in production requires a manual install.
1. Download the OmniLog zip file
2. Unpack the file to your project's directory as `omnilog`
Done!
